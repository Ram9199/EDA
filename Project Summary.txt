Project Summary
In this project, I was responsible for preprocessing and cleaning a housing dataset to prepare it for modeling. The objective was to ensure that the data was clean, consistent, and ready for analysis by the modeling team. Through a series of data exploration and transformation steps, missing values were handled, outliers were identified and addressed, categorical variables were encoded, and numerical features were scaled. The final dataset is well-structured, with all necessary preprocessing steps completed, allowing the modeling team to focus on building predictive models without worrying about data quality issues.

Key Actions and Technologies Used
Utilized Python and Pandas Library to load and manipulate the dataset for data processing tasks.
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.
Handled Missing Data by using appropriate imputation techniques and dropping rows/columns where necessary, ensuring that the dataset remained robust and informative.
Performed Outlier Detection and Treatment, removing data points that could skew the results and affect model performance.
Encoded Categorical Variables using techniques like one-hot encoding to convert them into a numerical format suitable for modeling.
Scaled Numerical Features to ensure consistency across the dataset, which is crucial for certain machine learning algorithms.
Documented Each Step with justifications for the transformations performed, ensuring clear communication with the modeling team and other stakeholders.
